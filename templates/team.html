      <p class="justify">Since becoming a software engineer in 2012, she's worked for a better, more diverse software industry by organizing support groups, meetups, workshops, and the #ILookLikeAnEngineer ad campaign. Michelle's experience working in tech and volunteering in the community in San Francisco revealed two glaring issues: lack of diversity on tech teams and high income disparity. Techtonica is her vision to help tech companies and people who need more opportunities thrive together.</p>
