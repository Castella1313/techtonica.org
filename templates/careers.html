			<li>Unequivocal support for parents, people who don't identify with the gender binary, and people with disabilities</li>
			<li>Dedication to underprivileged populations and willingness to examine your biases often</li>
			<li>Willingness to do pretty much anything—we are a brand-new nonprofit that works much like a tech startup</li>
			<li>Ability to handle many different projects and tasks simultaneously</li>
			<li>Ability to take tasks and run with them independently</li>

		<p class="justify">Because this role involves a lot of people-interacting, it might be best if you're extroverted or at least an ambivert, but you should also respect the space needed by introverts, especially since you'll be working closely with the founder, who is an introvert.</p>
